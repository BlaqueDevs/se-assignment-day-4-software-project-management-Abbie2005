2. Problems are often discovered late, making them costly to fix.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Answer
Types of Project that Agile Might be More Beneficial Than Waterfall
1. Requirements are unclear or might change: You’re figuring things out as you go.
2. Frequent feedback is needed: You want to show progress and get input regularly.
3. The project is complex: There are many moving parts, and you need to adapt quickly.

Examples of Agile Project
1. Mobile App Development: Building a fitness app where you release features like step tracking first, then add meal planning later based on user requests.
2. Software for Startups: Redesigning an e-commerce site where you improve the homepage first, then the product pages, and finally the checkout process.
3. Game Development: Developing a video game where you release a basic version first, then add levels, characters, and features over time.

Examples of Waterfall Project
1. Building Construction: Building a house where you design it first, then lay the foundation, build the walls, and finally add the roof.
2. Manufacturing a Product: Making a smartphone where you design it, then build the components, assemble it, and finally test it.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Answer
How Does Defining the Project Scope Contribute to Successful Project Planning.
1. Keeps Everyone on the Same Page: The team and stakeholders know exactly what to expect.
2. Prevents Scope Creep: Stops the project from growing out of control with endless new requests.
3. Sets Clear Goals: Helps the team focus on what’s important.
4. Saves Time and Money: Avoids wasting resources on unnecessary tasks.

What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)?
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is like breaking a big task into smaller, manageable pieces. It’s a tree-like diagram that splits the project into phases, tasks, substasks.

Why is it useful?
1. Organizes the Project: Breaks the work into clear, manageable pieces.
2. Helps with Planning: Makes it easier to estimate time, cost, and resources.
3. Assigns Responsibilities: Shows who’s responsible for each task.
4. Tracks Progress: Lets you see what’s done and what’s left.
